# **D&D Boardgame** 

For my Mid Term in my Game Design school i had to programm a simple boardgame with the Theme of "Dungeons and Dragons". I used simple programmer Art (Cubes and single-color materials) as placeholders for this project and simply focused on playability. Taking inspiration from the original D&D boardgame, the player controls multiple Heroes at the same time. Each Hero has unique stats and abilities and the objective is simply to kill all Enemies in the current Map. Controls and game mechanics are really self explanatory. The game is turn based and each Hero has 2 moves per turn. Combat is handled with rolling 6-sided dice, which was the most complex mechanic i had to implement.
